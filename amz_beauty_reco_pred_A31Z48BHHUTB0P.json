      "Proraso Protective and Moisturizing Shaving Cream is ideal for a classic moisturizing shave. This hydrating cream helps comfort skin with extra-soothing and softening ingredients including Aloe Vera and Vitamin E, and a modern, spicy fragrance with notes of amber and musk. Made with a special \"hot soap\" process, it's left to mature in small batches for 3 days, producing an extremely fine, thick and creamy soap that produces a soft, rich lather. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been innovating professional highest-quality products in the shaving world for generations, and has evolved to become a staple of Italian culture. From the first product -- Pre-Shave Cream -- in 1948, to now, the Martelli family principles hold true: to create professional, quality products that deliver a pleasurable and impeccable shave, in the barbershop and at home.",
      "Proraso has been transforming shaving into a pleasurable experience for decades. The distinctive quality and performance of Proraso products has made them a staple in barbershops throughout Italy.",
      "",
      "Short on time? Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don&#039;t have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.",
      "If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if youre shaving in the shower. Shave and rinse, following with your favorite Proraso After Shave Balm or Lotion.",
